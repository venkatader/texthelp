Code Structure
1.	Main Configuration File (main.tf)
o	This file acts as the entry point for Terraform. It includes:
	Provider Definition: Specifies AWS as the cloud provider and configures the AWS region for the deployment.
	Module Invocations: Calls reusable modules for creating the VPC, ECS cluster, ElastiCache, and RDS.
________________________________________
Modules
Each module encapsulates specific parts of the infrastructure for modularity and reusability.
1. vpc Module
•	Purpose: Creates a custom VPC with public and private subnets distributed across multiple availability zones.
•	Key Features:
o	Defines a CIDR block for the VPC.
o	Configures an Internet Gateway for public resources.
o	Sets up a NAT Gateway for private resources to access the internet.
o	Adds public and private subnets with proper routing.
2. ecs Module
•	Purpose: Deploys the Node.js web application using ECS Fargate.
•	Key Features:
o	Creates an ECS cluster.
o	Defines a task definition for the Node.js container, specifying the container image, ports, and environment variables.
o	Configures a service to run tasks and integrates it with an Application Load Balancer (ALB) for traffic distribution.
3. redis Module
•	Purpose: Provisions ElastiCache for Redis to improve application performance by caching frequently accessed data.
•	Key Features:
o	Creates a Redis cluster in private subnets.
o	Configures security groups to allow access only from ECS tasks.
4. rds Module
•	Purpose: Deploys a MySQL database using Amazon RDS.
•	Key Features:
o	Creates a managed MySQL database in private subnets.
o	Configures multi-AZ deployment for high availability.
o	Adds encryption at rest and automated backups.
o	Sets up security groups to restrict access to ECS.

Outputs
•	Outputs provide key information after the infrastructure is provisioned, such as:
o	Load balancer DNS name (to access the web application).
o	Redis endpoint (for the application to connect to the cache).
o	RDS endpoint (for the application to connect to the database).
________________________________________
Variables
•	Purpose: Centralizes configuration options to make the infrastructure flexible and reusable across environments.
•	Examples:
o	VPC CIDR block, number of subnets, ECS cluster name, container image, database credentials, etc.

CI/CD Pipeline Integration
The pipeline automates the deployment process for this Terraform configuration:
1.	Linting and Validation:
o	Ensures the Terraform code is syntactically correct using tools like terraform fmt and terraform validate.
2.	Plan Stage:
o	Generates a detailed execution plan to preview changes without applying them.
3.	Apply Stage:
o	Deploys the infrastructure to the specified AWS account securely and predictably.
4.	State Management:
o	Configures remote backend storage (e.g., AWS S3) for managing Terraform state files securely.
